# cond_engine
A text-based graphics engine built in Python.
For now it is only in Italian, but I will soon translate the code into English. 

To use the code, simply import this file and use the various classes/functions as in the example. 
This engine can be used in many types of projects (videogames, simulations, etc...).
For example I used it for Egg Condition 3 ðŸ¥šðŸ¥šðŸ¥š
